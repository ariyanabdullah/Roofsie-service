            are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally
            scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are
            document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are
            better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for
            unstructured data like documents or JSON.

            Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information
            between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains
            encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed
            using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be
            altered after the token is issued. A JWT is a string made up of
            three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In
            the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT
            looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
